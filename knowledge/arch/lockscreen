i3 needs
	a lock function, e.g. i3lock
	a screensaver to cover what you were doing

https://github.com/pavanjadhaw/betterlockscreen
	seems to provide that

	trizen i3lock-color betterlockscreen

setup
	betterlockscreen -u <path/to/img>

in i3config set
	bindsym $mod+x exec "betterlockscreen -l dim"

	for some reason mod+shift+x does not work?!?
	also after deep sleep no lockscreen yet
